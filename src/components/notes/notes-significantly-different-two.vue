    <p>* Significantly different (<em>p</em> &lt; .05) from the U.S. average at the .05
        level of statistical significance.</p>
    <p>NOTE: The PISA index of economic, social, and cultural status (ESCS) was created
        using student reports on parental occupation, the highest level of parental
        education, and an index of home possessions related to family wealth, home
        educational resources and possessions related to "classical" culture in the
        family home. The home possessions relating to "classical" culture in the family
        home included possessions such as works of classical literature, books of
        poetry, and works of art (e.g., paintings). The OECD average is the average of
        the national averages of the OECD member countries, with each country weighted
        equally. Education systems are included in the OECD average if they were OECD
        members in 2022. Average scores by quarter are calculated based on the
        distribution of student scores within each education system. Scores are reported
        on a scale from 0 to 1,000.</p>
