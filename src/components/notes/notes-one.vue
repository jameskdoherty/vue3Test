    <p>* The difference in average scores of 15-year-old male and female students is
        significantly different (<em>p</em> &lt; .05) at the .05 level of statistical

    <p>NOTE: Differences were computed using unrounded numbers. Scores are reported on a
        scale from 0 to 1,000. Education systems are marked as OECD countries if they
        were OECD members in 2022. The OECD average is the average of the national
        average differences of the OECD member countries, with each country weighted
        equally. Italics indicate non-OECD countries and education systems. B-S-J-Z
        (China) refers to the four PISA participating China provinces: Beijing,
        Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang.</p>
