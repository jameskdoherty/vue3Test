  <p>Mathematics literacy was a <span class="tooltip-container">major domain <span class="tooltip-text bottom">As the
        <strong>major domain</strong>, a greater proportion of the assessment is devoted to the subject area, including
        newly developed items, allowing for more detailed analyses of student performance in the subject. In addition,
        most items in the background questionnaires for students and schools focus on some aspect of the major domain
        subject, such as how it is taught, school resources related to the teaching of the subject, or students' levels of
        engagement with the subject.</span></span>in PISA 2022 as it was in 2003 and 2012. For 2022, the <a
      href="https://pisa2022-maths.oecd.org/ca/index.html">PISA mathematics literacy framework</a> was updated to reflect
    mathematics in a rapidly changing world driven by new technologies and trends in which citizens are creative and
    engaged, making nonroutine judgments for themselves and the society in which they live. This brings into focus
    students' ability to reason mathematically and to understand computational thinking concepts that are part of
    mathematical literacy.</p>
  <p>In PISA, the assessment of mathematics literacy focuses on students' capacity to formulate, use, and interpret
    mathematics in a variety of contexts. Proficiency in mathematics is more than the ability to reproduce the knowledge
    of mathematical concepts and procedures; it is conceptualized as students' ability to extrapolate from what they know
    and apply their knowledge in both familiar and unfamiliar situations.</p>
  <blockquote>In PISA 2022, mathematics literacy is defined as students' capacity to formulate, employ, and interpret
    mathematics in a variety of contexts. It includes reasoning mathematically and using mathematical concepts,
    procedures, facts, and tools to describe, explain, and predict phenomena.</blockquote>
