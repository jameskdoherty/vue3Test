      the PISA reading literacy assessment component included only trend items used in prior cycles of PISA, including the

          devoted to the subject area, including newly developed items, allowing for more detailed analyses of student
          performance in the subject. In addition, most items in the background questionnaires for students and
          schools focus on some aspect of the major domain subject, such as how it is taught, school resources related
          to the teaching of the subject, or students' levels of engagement with the subject.</span></span>. Read more

        literacy framework for PISA</a>.</p>
    <p>Reading involves not only the printed page but also digital formats. Increasingly, it requires readers to distinguish
      between fact and opinion, synthesize and interpret texts from multiple sources, and deal with conflicting information
      across source materials.</p>
      <blockquote>In PISA 2022 science literacy is defined as students' capacity to understand, use, evaluate, reflect on, and engage with texts in order to achieve one's goals; develop one's knowledge and potential; and participate in society.</blockquote>
