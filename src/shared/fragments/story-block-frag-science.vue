      literacy framework for PISA 2022</a>.</p>
  <p>In PISA, the assessment of science literacy focuses on students' ability to engage with science-related issues, and
    with the ideas of science, as a reflective citizen. It requires students to engage in reasoned discourse about science
    and technology utilizing their knowledge of facts and theories to explain phenomena scientifically. It also requires
    students to know the standard methodological procedures and patterns of reasoning used in science to evaluate or
    design scientific inquiries and interpret evidence.</p>
  <blockquote>In PISA 2022, science literacy is defined as students' ability to engage with science-related issues, and
    with the ideas of science, as a reflective citizen. A scientifically literate person is willing to engage in reasoned
    discourse about science and technology, which requires the competencies to explain phenomena scientifically, evaluate
    and design scientific enquiry, and interpret data and evidence scientifically.
