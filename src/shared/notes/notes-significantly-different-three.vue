        <p>NOTE: Scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000. The National School Lunch
            Program provides free or reduced-price lunch for students meeting certain income
            guidelines. The percentage of students eligible for this program is an indicator
            of the socioeconomic level of families served by the school. Data in this figure
            are based on principals' responses to a question in the school questionnaire
            that asked the approximate percentage of eligible students in the school during
            the previous school year. Free or reduced-price lunch data are for public
            schools only.</p>
