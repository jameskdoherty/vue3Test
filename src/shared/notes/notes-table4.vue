        <p>NOTE: Data shown for education systems that participated in both cycles of PISA in 2006 and 2022. Scores are
            reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000. Differences were computed using unrounded numbers. The default graphic or
            table view shows education systems ordered by the score difference between the two selected assessment years.
            The ordering of notes and special symbols in the NOTE section follows the order shown in the default
            graphic/table view. Education systems are marked as OECD countries if they were OECD members in 2022. All OECD
            members except for Luxembourg participated in the PISA 2022 cycle. Italics indicate non-OECD countries and
            education systems.</p>
