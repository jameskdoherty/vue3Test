        <p>NOTE: Scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000. Education systems are marked as OECD
            countries if they were OECD members in 2022. The OECD average is the average of the national
            averages of the OECD member countries, with each country weighted equally. Italics indicate
            non-OECD countries and education systems. B-S-J-Z (China) refers to the four PISA
            participating China provinces: Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. Although Vietnam
            participated in PISA 2018, technical problems with its data prevent results from being
            discussed in this report.</p>
