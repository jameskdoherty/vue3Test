    <p>* Significantly different (<em>p</em> &lt; .05) from the U.S. average at the .05
        level of statistical significance.</p>
    <p>NOTE: Scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000. Reporting standards were
        not met for American Indian/Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific
        Islander. Black includes African American, and Hispanic includes Latino.
        Students who identified themselves as being of Hispanic origin were classified
        as Hispanic, regardless of their race. Although data for some race/ethnicities
        were not shown separately because the reporting standards were not met, they are
        included in the U.S. totals.</p>
