        <p>NOTE: Scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000. Differences were computed using unrounded numbers. The
            default graphic or table view shows education systems ordered by the 90thâ€“10th score gap in 2022. The ordering
            of notes and special symbols in the NOTE section follows the order shown in the default graphic/table view.
            Education systems are marked as OECD countries if they were OECD members in 2022. All OECD members except for
            Luxembourg participated in the PISA 2022 cycle. The OECD average is the average of the national averages of the
            OECD member countries, with each country weighted equally. Italics indicate non-OECD countries and education
            systems.</p>
