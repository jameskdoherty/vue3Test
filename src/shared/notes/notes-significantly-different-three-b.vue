        <p>*** Significantly different (<em>p</em> &lt; .05) from both the U.S. and OECD averages at the .05 level of
            statistical significance.</p>
        <p>NOTE: Scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000. Differences were computed using unrounded numbers.
            Reporting standards were not met for American Indian/Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander.
            Black includes African American, and Hispanic includes Latino. Students who identified themselves as being of
            Hispanic origin were classified as Hispanic, regardless of their race. Although data for some race/ethnicities
            were not shown separately because the reporting standards were not met, they are included in the U.S. totals.
